    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses [Ultralytics](https://docs.ultralytics.com/) to train YOLO11, YOLOv8, or YOLOv5 object detection models with a custom dataset. At the end of this Colab, you'll have a custom YOLO model capable of identifying various rice plant leaf diseases, such as bacterial leaf blight, brown spot, and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working in Colab\n",
    "Colab provides a virtual machine in your browser complete with a Linux OS, filesystem, Python environment, and best of all, a free GPU. We'll install PyTorch and Ultralytics in this environment and use it to train our model. Simply click the Play button on sections of code in this notebook to execute them on the virtual machine.\n",
